in wireless\\ncellular networks that can be employed to improve spectral and energy efﬁciency, increase data rates, and\\nreduce links latency. this paper investigates ﬁfth generation and beyond (5gb) networks, the basics of\\nd2d communication, applications, and classiﬁcation. herein, d2d in in-band (ibd) and out-band (obd)\\nmodes are discussed. this paper also presents the integration of d2d communication with other prominent\\ntechnologies and demonstrates the importance of integration with possible solutions in improving network\\nperformance. we further investigate the challenges of d2d communication, opportunities, and future\\nresearch directions of d2d in 5gb networks. in addition, d2d communication in 6g network challenges\\nand open research areas are introduced.\\n\\nindex

wireless communication demands for higher data\\nrates, lower energy consumption, low latency, coverage area,\\nas well as efﬁcient spectrum sharing are rapidly increasing\\nday by day. the number of connected devices is estimated\\nto be over 50 billion in the year 2020 [1]–[3], in which\\nmobile data trafﬁc is projected to grow monthly from 13.8 in\\n2017 to 110 exabytes (eb) till the end of 2023 at a compound\\nannual growth rate (cagr) of 42% based on the ericsson\\nreport [4]. all these issues should be resolved to provide and\\nsupport the demands of the upcoming ﬁfth-generation (5g)\\n\\nthe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\\n\\napproving it for publication was stefano scanzio\\n\\n.\\n\\nand beyond (5gb). 5g was expected to launch in 2020 with\\na very high data rate and quality of services (qos), and\\nit aims to offer a 1000-fold rise in the total throughput.\\nmoreover, in order to achieve a ten-fold increase in indi-\\nvidual link throughput over the previous fourth-generation\\n(4g) wireless networks [5], [6], various technologies are\\nsuggested to be considered in order to fulﬁll 5gb require-\\nments such as an ultra-dense network (udn) with machine-\\nto-machine (m2m) in heterogeneous networks, in addition to\\nmillimeter-wave (mm-wave), massive mimo, virtualization\\nof wireless resources, visible light communication (vlc),\\nenergy harvesting, and cloud-based radio access network\\n(c-ran) [7]. a novel physical technology such as vlc\\nhas been suggested to deliver high data rates, where a\\n\\n30792\\n\\nthis

data rates with up to 100gbps and beyond [8]–[10].\\nfig.1 illustrates the development of mobile communication\\nnetworks, which involves 1g to 5g generations, technolo-\\ngies, systems, and standardizations.\\n\\nmany techniques and approaches have been implemented\\nto cope with the increasing demand for network capacity.\\nnew modulation techniques, signal processing, and spectrum\\nallocation techniques were employed to improve spectral efﬁ-\\nciency and link capacity. however, they require many small\\nbase stations in indoor environments in order to meet the\\nrequirements of the upcoming 5gb applications, although\\nimproving the channel capacity, transmission rate, bit error\\nrate (ber) performance as well as signal-to-noise (snr),\\ncould increase total spectral efﬁciency and bandwidth den-\\nsity [11], [12].\\n\\naccording to the current and expected requirements of\\ncommunication networks, an emerging technology called\\ndevice-to-device (d2d) communication has attracted atten-\\ntion as a critical key for cellular network performance\\nenhancement in 5gb [13], [14]. d2d communication offers\\nmany advantages for cellular networks, namely; (i) higher\\ntransmission rate, (ii) enhancing energy efﬁciency, (iii)\\nofﬂoading the overloaded cellular trafﬁc, (iv) wide cellular\\ncoverage, (v) reducing delay or latency, and (vi) higher spec-\\ntral efﬁciency [15]–[18]. d2d communication can be used in\\nseveral ﬁelds, such as public safety, network trafﬁc ofﬂoad-\\ning, military applications, social services, and gaming [19].\\nthe standardization of d2d communication was reviewed\\nby the third-generation partnership project (3gpp). 3gpp\\nis the leading standardization organization for 5g systems,\\n\\nfigure 2. d2d communication and cellular network.\\n\\nwhich deﬁned a collection of d2d scenarios in 5gb net-\\nworks [20], [21]. the latest 3gpp releases have given signif-\\nicant consideration to standardize d2d communication and\\ncombine it in the long-term evolution (lte) advanced ecosys-\\ntem [22]. detailed critical analysis, features, and discussion\\non d2d communication standardization over 3gpp releases\\nhave been presented in [23]–[26].\\n\\nvarious survey works have made a greater contribution to\\nthe research on d2d cellular networks in terms of mode selec-\\ntion, resource allocation, interference management, security,\\netc., which have always been to improve the d2d system per-\\nformance. however, a comprehensive survey of the current\\nexisting works on the aforementioned surveys in 5g, b5g,\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n30793\\n\\n\\x0cm. s. m. gismalla et al.: survey on d2d communication for 5gb/6g networks\\n\\ntion to transfer information through physical cables and con-\\nnectors. however, due to some challenges raised by multiple\\nconnectors, radio frequency (rf) technology was employed\\nto overcome these challenges. thus, information was trans-\\nmitted without human intervention, where rf signals trav-\\neled from and to the mobile user in the transmitter’s side to\\nthe base station (bs), and then bs relayed these signals to the\\nother mobile user at the receiver’s side, which is standard in\\nany typical cellular network as illustrated in [41]–[43]. after\\nthat, due to spectrum limitations of rf technologies in the\\ncellular network, d2d communications have been proposed\\nto handle internet and mobile calls data trafﬁc without any\\nadditional load to the core network [3], [44], which means\\ndirect communication between devices would be established\\nwithout relaying the signal through the bs or core of cellular\\nnetwork as demonstrated in fig.2.\\n\\na direct connection between two devices (i.e., mobile,\\ntablet, pc, etc.) underlaying cellular network represents\\na simple concept of\\nthe d2d communication mecha-\\nnism,\\nin which it could be classiﬁed based on spec-\\ntrum utilization into in-band and out-band communication,\\nas brieﬂy demonstrated with different classiﬁcation modes in\\nfig.3 [19], [45].\\n\\na. in-band d2d communication\\nthe motivation for selecting the in-band d2d (ibd) commu-\\nnication was its high ability to control a licensed spectrum;\\nhowever, it suffers from interference between d2d users and\\ncellular networks [45], [46]. furthermore, it is also consid-\\nered as one of the 5g technologies with spectrum efﬁciency\\nthat could be improved through reusing the frequency and\\ntime resources by the d2d users, in which resource sharing\\nor allocation between d2d users could be performed in two\\nways, namely; underlay and overlay modes [43].\\n\\n1) underlay mode\\nin underlay mode, the d2d and cellular communications\\nshare the same

vi\\ndescribes the d2d in 6g and critical requirements for a\\nsuccessful 6g network. the lessons learned and key ﬁnd-\\nings with suggestions for future research are demonstrated\\nin section vii and section viii, respectively. lastly, conclu-\\nsions are presented in section ix.\\n\\nii. d2d communication concept and\\nclassification\\nin the past decades, the transmission of information

comprises\\nof resource allocation, interference mitigation, and diver-\\nsity techniques [43]. therefore, direct d2d communication\\nunderlay mode could offer high spectral efﬁciency as well as\\nlow latency for an end-to-end connection and physical link\\nproximity, thus making it a possible solution for achieving\\nthe requirements of 5g.\\n\\n2) overlay mode\\nin overlay mode, d2d and cellular communications are given\\na dedicated portion of the wireless resources so that cellular\\nlinks are not inﬂuenced by d2d links [47]. nevertheless,\\ninterferences between d2d links remain present. the cellular\\nband or spectrum potion of overlay is shown in fig.4.\\n\\nb. out-band d2d communication\\nthe out-band d2d (obd) communication is another exciting\\nand attractive area for many researchers today since it uses an\\n\\nunlicensed spectrum utilized in various industrial, scientiﬁc,\\nand medical (ism) applications. besides, it is considered\\na 2.4g technology, making it difﬁcult for interference to\\noccur between cellular and d2d communications, as seen in\\nfig.5. however, the obd suffers from an uncontrolled way\\nof unlicensed spectrum [43], [49]. to employ the unlicensed\\nspectrum band, an additional interface that performs wi-fi\\ndirect, bluetooth, or zig-bee is a must. obd communications\\nare classiﬁed into two modes, based on other interface occur-\\nrences, namely controlled and autonomous modes, which are\\nbrieﬂy illustrated as follows:\\n\\n1) controlled mode\\nin this mode of obd communication, the cellular network\\nor base station will be controlled by radio interfaces. in pre-\\nvious studies, cellular networks have employed advanced\\nmanagement techniques that can improve the reliability and\\nefﬁciency of d2d communications [19], [43], and improve\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n30795\\n\\n\\x0cm. s. m. gismalla et al.: survey on d2d communication for 5gb/6g networks\\n\\nfuture [57]. video streaming involves transferring data or\\ncontents in a compressed form via the internet in real-time,\\nwhich results in watchable content without the need to wait\\nfor a completely downloaded video ﬁle [50]. however, point-\\nto-point (p2p) technology has the potential to allow all users\\nto share their videos through direct communication, cellular\\nnetwork, and ofﬂoading, as illustrated in fig.7 (step 4) [58].\\nit offers an alternative improved method of video streaming.\\nalternatively, d2d technology is better than conventional\\ncellular networks in sharing video streaming, video con-\\nferences, and video chat between devices within the same\\ncellular or adjacent networks nearby. according to future\\nnetwork requirements for video streaming, the quality of\\nexperience (qoe) is strongly inﬂuenced by video quality\\nadaptation. therefore, a new quality adaptation technique\\nwas proposed for scalable video in d2d communication\\nnetwork [13]. in addition to an extensive survey, a dis-\\ncussion on video transmission and qoe was conducted in\\nstudies [59], [60], which handled challenges and proposed\\npossible solutions to enhance the video quality and manage\\ninterferences between cellular links and d2d links.\\n\\nc. machine to machine\\nm2m communication is considered one of the promising\\ntechnologies for m2m telemetry, which involves devices\\nand objects with communication and computing capabilities\\nwithout the need for human connection [50], [61], [62]. m2m\\nis often utilized to monitor certain automatic transmissions\\nof data collected from remote sensors to a central unit to\\nbe analyzed. this is achieved by software agents or human\\nbeings, as shown in fig.8. m2m technology has many appli-\\ncations, including, but not limited to, car automation, smart\\nhouses, environment monitoring, industrial automation, mili-\\ntary operations, etc. furthermore, m2m machines are often\\npositioned near each other in many applications to deploy\\nd2d connections within a building [63], [59]. implement-\\ning a direct d2d route in m2m technology will result in\\nload distribution and delay reduction in deployed networks.\\nmoreover, a cognitive m2m could be employed to maximize\\nenergy efﬁciency [64] by utilizing a recently developed joint\\noptimization algorithm that features power control, peer dis-\\ncovery, channel selection, and time allocation problem.\\n\\nd. emergency networks\\nthe urbanization in both developing and developed worlds\\nare increasing rapidly. currently, more than 50% of the pop-\\nulation is concentrated and lives in cities. globally, this per-\\ncentage is expected to grow rapidly in the upcoming decades.\\ntherefore, ﬂexible and reliable communication networks in\\ndense urban areas must secure global cities from unfortunate\\nterror attacks, such as the new york city 9/11 catastrophe\\nand 7/7 metro bombings in london [65]. furthermore, in the\\nevent of natural disasters and during search and rescue oper-\\nations, base stations are often shut down or overloaded, and\\ncould only provide limited services for a speciﬁc limited\\nnumber of users or equipment. hence, in emergencies, d2d-\\n\\nfigure

mode\\nalternatively, this mode does not require any changes at\\ncellular networks or base stations. it could be easily deployed,\\nwhich means that autonomous d2d interfaces could be coor-\\ndinated by users, resulting in cellular network overhead mit-\\nigation [19]. these autonomous d2d interfaces could be\\nbluetooth or wi-fi direct.\\n\\nincluding video streaming,\\n\\niii. d2d communication applications\\nd2d communication can be employed in several short\\nrange applications,\\n(m2m),\\ndata and voice, and emergency network, as illustrated in\\nfig.6. furthermore, d2d can be used in online gaming,\\nlocal advertising, cognitive-communication,\\nmulticasting,\\ncooperative communication, and the internet of\\nthings\\n(iot) [35], [50]–[52].\\n\\na. data service and local voice\\nthe transfer of data service between two devices within d2d\\ncoverage areas can be achieved via d2d communication.\\nan increase in data rate and latency reduction could be\\nacquired through d2d technology deployment [50], [53].\\nadditionally, voice chat services could be supported within\\nnarrow proximity coverage areas such as cubicles, big halls,\\nor can deliver to nearby devices. therefore, local voice trans-\\nmission through d2d technology could improve network\\nperformance in terms of data rate, qos, and latency in a\\nmanner that could overcome real-time voice transmission\\nlimitations [54]–[56].\\n\\nb. video streaming\\naccording to cisco, video sharing through the internet is\\nprojected to take up over 90% of internet trafﬁc in the

d2d\\ncommunications system with iovt, iomt, trafﬁc, and public\\nsafety.\\n\\niv. integration of d2d communication with\\nrecent techniques\\nrapid advancements, growth, and innovations in mobile com-\\nmunications technologies result in a higher number of hetero-\\ngeneous cellular networks. recent advancement in cellular\\nnetworks is the introduction of very-high-speed 5g technol-\\nogy to the mobile market. therefore, newly-introduced 5g\\nnetworks and beyond would comprise all types of advanced\\ntechnologies that offer remarkable services. d2d underlay\\ncellular network is an advanced technology that could offer\\nimproved energy efﬁciency, increased capacity, and many\\nother advantages due to its cellular network trafﬁc ofﬂoading\\ncapabilities. however, it faces many challenges at the same\\ntime [68], [69]. to overcome all these challenges as well\\nas enhance the network performance, we investigated the\\nintegration and combination of d2d communication with\\nother advanced technologies such as the iot, vlc, udn, etc.\\nfig.11 illustrates the most prominent technologies that can\\nbe integrated with d2d communications to support 5gb net-\\nworks. a brief introduction of these technologies is presented\\nin the following section.\\n\\na. cloud radio access network\\ncloud radio access network (c-ran) is a promising access\\nnetwork technique that could be employed to address\\nincreased mobile trafﬁc and optimize network perfor-\\nmance [70], [71], in addition to scalability and heterogeneity\\nmanagement of upcoming wireless networks. c-ran has a\\ncentralized object that aids in advanced joint mobility and\\nradio resource management, which can reduce the interfer-\\nence and increase data rate as well [72]. the uplink and\\ndownlink scenarios for c-ran were investigated [73], [74],\\nwhere different frameworks and strategies were implemented\\nto improve its capacity and optimal outage probability was\\nobtained. although c-ran has many advantages, it also\\nsuffers from a few drawbacks, such as link delay, one of\\nits major inherent issues. to avoid this issue, a new d2d-\\ncommunication-based combination paradigm was proposed\\nin [75].\\n\\nd2d and c-ran technologies combination does not only\\nplay a signiﬁcant role in solving the delay issue, but it could\\nalso fulﬁll most of 5g requirements in terms of cost, delay,\\ncapacity, mobility, and energy efﬁciency [75]. both d2d\\nand c-ran have been investigated to optimize resource\\nallocation and mode selection simultaneously in [76], [77],\\nwhich resulted in higher throughput. d2d can be enabled\\nin c-ran to improve qos as well as minimize transmitted\\npower in [78]. also, c-ran-based-d2d could be employed\\nto manage resource allocation for 5g heterogeneous net-\\nworks [79], [80]. the performance evolution of d2d-c-ran\\nbased network in 5g heterogeneous udn has yet to be\\n\\n30798\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n\\x0cm. s. m. gismalla et al.:

ful-\\nﬁllment of the 5g requirements. moreover, new algorithms\\nfor delay reduction in hybrid d2d-c-ran network is needed\\nto improve the performance in terms of interference, optimal\\noutage probability, throughput, qos, etc.\\n\\nb. millimeter-wave\\nthe electromagnetic spectrum is becoming more and more\\ncongested; as a result, its resources have become sparse due to\\nthe massive applications demand, which occupies most of its\\nremaining frequency bands. therefore, moving to millimeter-\\nwave (mm-wave) bands has become a necessity for the large\\nunused bandwidths [81], [82]. the mm-wave spectrum is\\ndescribed by an extremely high-frequency band (ehf) and\\nranges from 30 to 300 ghz. these bands could support 5g\\nnetworks with a possibility of obtaining 1000 folds the capac-\\nity compared to 4g solutions [76], [81]. employing d2d\\ncommunication in micro-wave bands suffers from high inter-\\nference and insufﬁcient bandwidth [83]. therefore, enabling\\nd2d in an mm-wave band is another possible solution to\\nthose problems.\\n\\nmm-wave provides low latency and high data rate; how-\\never, it suffers from inefﬁcient power consumption and prop-\\nagation shortcomings [84]. to overcome these challenges,\\npower consumption could be improved by d2d communi-\\ncation integration with mm-wave technology as introduced\\nin [85], which resulted in improved energy efﬁciency. this\\nintegration provided high data rates, low interference as\\nwell as improved power consumption [86]. in addition, the\\noutage probability and data rates were investigated for a\\ncombination of both and based on various mm-wave parame-\\nters [86]. a new optimization problem formula has also been\\nimplemented to investigate resource and power allocation of\\nd2d and mm-wave integration in [87]. besides, an exten-\\nsive survey about integrating both technologies has been\\ndone, which covered cooperative communication, caching,\\nscheduling techniques, beamforming, and their possible solu-\\ntion approaches [88], [89].\\n\\nmoreover, both technologies suffer challenges such as\\nblockage modeling, heterogeneous networks, and densiﬁ-\\ncation. despite all mentioned challenges, there are great\\nchances for integrated d2d communication with mm-wave\\nto become a promising solution form many issues relating to\\n\\nvolume 10,

that humans utilize in the internet,\\ndevices are the major users in the iot ecosystem [90]. the\\nfast growth of smartphones plays a signiﬁcant role in sup-\\nporting iot technology and it has gained a strong interest\\nby many due to its features that can support the creation\\nand the development of various services and applications.\\nmoreover, d2d and iot technologies integration have the\\npotential to satisfy upcoming 5g requirements, especially\\nin terms of system capacity, latency, or delay, as well as\\nspectral efﬁciency [51], [91]. two interference management\\ntechniques termed as cooperative pairing (coop) and ﬁxed\\npower margin (fpm) have been investigated to improve the\\noutage probability and qos requirement for the combined\\nd2d and iot ecosystem [92]. the role of d2d communica-\\ntion in the development of the iot ecosystem was extensively\\ndiscussed, where the past, current status, and expected future\\nissues were also presented [93]. fig.12 shows the integrated\\nd2d communication with 5g iot networks [94].\\n\\nd. visible light communication\\nrf technology suffers from capacity crunch, interference,\\nand other constraints, that affect the performance of the com-\\nmunication system. in order to avoid some of these con-\\nstraints, a new technology named vlc was introduced [95]–\\n[97]. vlc features a high bandwidth that could reach up\\nto terahertz (thz), in addition to low power, license-free\\ndeployment, and interference immunity [98], [99]. table\\n3 provides a comparison between vlc and rf technolo-\\ngies [100], [101]. similar to d2d communications, vlc\\nsystem has limited coverage distance. therefore, both tech-\\nnologies would be suitable for indoor applications; such sce-\\nnarios can produce high capacity and high data rates.\\n\\nfigure 11. integration of d2d communication with different recent\\ntechnologies in 5g.\\n\\n5g and beyond. the integration of both technologies opens\\nareas for researchers in

method was utilized to investi-\\ngate resource allocation for a hybrid d2d and vlc in\\nheterogeneous networks [96]. it was shown that hybrid\\nrf-vlc in d2d communication network achieved improved\\nperformance in terms of capacity crunch in indoor environ-\\nments [102]. furthermore, an rf-vlc d2d system maxi-\\nmized the capacity of rf d2d communication and vlc d2d\\ncommunication systems with rates of 4.1 and 1.5, respec-\\ntively [103]. fig.13 illustrates a hybrid vlc-rf link in a d2d\\ncommunication system, where device user equipment (due)\\nrepresents the device user equipment, t and r denote the\\ntransmitter and receiver, respectively.\\n\\nthe mobility management of combined d2d communi-\\ncation with hybrid rf/vlc bands has been investigated\\nin [104], [105]. the combination of all these technolo-\\ngies could improve system capacity and overcome the over-\\ncrowded rf bands [10]. therefore, new algorithms were\\ndeveloped for d2d communication to switch from rf to\\nvlc and vice versa based on average energy efﬁciency, sum\\ncapacity, and outage ratio.\\n\\nfigure 13. hybrid vlc- rf in d2d communication system.\\n\\ne. ultra-dense network\\ncurrently, researchers are discussing and investigating the\\npotential of combining ultra-dense networks (udns) with\\n\\nvarious technologies in order to fulﬁll the extraordinary\\ncapacity requirement of 5g [106], [107]. the distribution\\nof ultra-dense small cells instead of conventional macrocells\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n30801\\n\\n\\x0cin the coverage area is known as udn. however, udn\\nintroduces new challenges that need to be solved, such as\\ninterference, degraded qos, and high energy consumption.\\nto overcome these challenges, udn should be integrated\\nwith other technologies such as d2d communication. fig.14\\nshows a simple combination of udn and d2d communica-\\ntion, in which different cell sizes such as macrocell, femto-\\ncell, and picocell are distributed to enhance the rising number\\nof devices or user equipment (ue) [108]. moreover, the ue\\nor devices located at cell edge that lacks connectivity, due to\\ncoverage limitations, require a relayer for incorporation and\\nconnection with the d2d communication cell.\\n\\nalthough udn has interference challenges, qos, and\\nother constraints, it could improve the performance of the net-\\nwork and increase its capacity 100-fold [109]. furthermore,\\nd2d communication integration is a signiﬁcant factor in sav-\\ning energy consumption due to the massive cell distribution\\nwithin udn [108]. besides, it can provide support for other\\nsolutions that could overcome the challenges to satisfy the\\nrequirements of 5g and beyond.\\n\\nf. unmanned aerial vehicle\\nin remote, disaster-affected, and rural areas, it is often dif-\\nﬁcult to build wireless networks due to challenging terrain\\nor lack of infrastructure. however, unmanned aerial vehicles\\n(uavs) could be immediately deployed to establish a d2d\\nauthorized wireless network with high qos, which make\\nthem a promising technology for emergency scenarios [110]–\\n[112]. alternatively, d2d communication plays a signiﬁcant\\nrole in improving the performance of uav in terms of capac-\\nity and coverage expansion with proper communication in\\nwireless cellular networks [113].\\n\\npotential challenges of integrating uavs and d2d com-\\nmunication networks were investigated in [54], in which the\\nemployment of dynamic multi uavs was explored. more-\\nover, a 3d resource sharing between d2d and uavs was\\ninvestigated to improve the spectral efﬁciency of cellular\\nnetworks in [114]. besides, in [115], the authors proposed\\nand evaluated the performance of a couple of mode selec-\\ntion schemes for d2d-enabled uav-based wireless networks,\\nwhere they utilized received signal strength threshold and\\naverage distance threshold to improve signal quality and\\nconnectivity in the case of emergencies. furthermore, d2d\\ncommunication and caching technologies were employed to\\nmitigate uav-assisted cellular network trafﬁc [116]. besides\\nthat, trajectory optimization and analysis of cache-enabled\\nuav-assisted cellular networks based on d2d communica-\\ntion underlay were discussed, in which the dynamic and static\\nuav deployments were considered. although both uav and\\nd2d technologies have various advantages and could be\\npromising candidates for 5gb network fulﬁllment, their high\\nmobility and dynamic topology, when combined, could hin-\\nder the performance of allocation algorithm in a conventional\\nchannel, in addition to interference, energy consumption,\\nand a limited number of available orthogonal channels for\\nresource allocation. the development of new algorithms and\\n\\nm. s. m. gismalla et al.: survey on d2d communication for 5gb/6g networks\\n\\noptimization solutions for these issues have yet to be resolved\\nand remain an attractive problem to be researched in the\\nfuture, along with the potential use of uav as a portable\\nenergy source, due to its ﬂexibility.\\n\\nv. challenges and possible solutions for d2d\\ncommunication in 5gb networks\\nas discussed previously, d2d communication presents a\\nnovel paradigm and standard that could be incorporated\\nin contemporary mobile cellular networks,\\nin which it\\ncan facilitate improved data exchange between proximate\\ndevices. network performance improvements are continu-\\nously needed. therefore, mobile operators are consistently\\ndeveloping technologies that support close-proximity ser-\\nvices by advancing d2d communications technologies [28].\\nthe taxonomy challenges for the d2d communication\\ntechnique in 5gb are as demonstrated in fig. 15. it includes\\nthe different parameters which categorize the available lit-\\nerature in d2d communication networks. the taxonomy\\nincludes six divisions, each of which displays various param-\\neters, their sub-divisions, and the related literature. the\\nparameters on which the category is done are resource allo-\\ncation of the radio spectrum, interference management, com-\\npatibility between devices in heterogeneous networks, mode\\nselection, security, and mobility.\\n\\nresource allocation for d2d communication in 5gb is\\neither underlay or overlay, and both are categorized as central-\\nized, distributed, and semi-distributed. it is also managed by\\nvarious algorithms and optimization problems [117]–[119].\\ninterference is classiﬁed into interference cancellation, inter-\\nference coordination, and interference avoidance [26], [120].\\nfurthermore, interference cancellation is divided into three\\ntypes known as sic, pic, and iic. various mechanisms are\\nemployed for interference avoidance, which includes mode\\nselection, joint power control, transmit power control, joint\\nresource allocation, and mimo techniques.\\n\\nheterogeneous network is categorized into access mode,\\ncell type, and network model based on the past works [121]–\\n[123], and each category involves sub-branches. mode selec-\\ntion in d2d communication is classiﬁed based on trans-\\nmission modes and control. both of them are divided into\\nsub-division as discussed in [124], [125].\\nsecurity is categorized into requirements, threats, and solu-\\ntions. the requirements are discussed, which contain c\\\\i, au,\\nfac, pr, re, a\\\\d, and nr [126], [127]. besides that, vul-\\nnerability classiﬁcations include physical attacks, negotiated\\nids, conﬁguration attacks, protocol attacks, attacks on core\\nnetworks, and user data and privacy attacks [28], [126], [128].\\nfour types of security solutions are classiﬁed, namely secure\\nrouting, access control, physical layer security, and authen-\\ntication, and key management [126]. the mobility manage-\\nment contains joint handover, half handover, and sidelink-\\nassisted handover [27], [104], [129]. all these challenges and\\npossible solutions for d2d communications in the context\\nof 5g networks and beyond are discussed in the following\\nsubsections. also, some notable methods with the ability\\n\\n30802\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n\\x0cm. s. m. gismalla et al.: survey on d2d communication for 5gb/6g networks\\n\\nfigure 14. general example of udn [108].\\n\\nto solve d2d communication challenges were investigated,\\nalong with in-depth technical discussion that includes objec-\\ntives, contributions, mechanisms, and results (see table 4).\\n\\na. resource allocation\\nradio resource allocation is an essential element in maintain-\\ning and creating direct connections between d2d pairs under\\ncellular networks [32], [130]. the advantages of d2d radio\\nresource allocations are ﬂexibility, ubiquitous availability,\\nlow latency, and low cost [51]. spectrum sharing between\\nd2d users and cellular user equipment (cue), mainly within\\nin-band mode, can improve spectral and energy efﬁciency by\\nmanaging co-channel interference [30], [131], [132]. another\\nnovel technique is sparse code multiple access (scma),\\nwhich was utilized in d2d communications for 5g networks\\nparadigm to improve resource and power utilization in hybrid\\ncellular networks [133]. however, security issues and fair-\\nness of communication have yet to be explored. meanwhile,\\nvarious resource allocation methods with different perfor-\\nmance objectives were investigated in [51], [134]–[136]. for\\nfuture directions, effective resource allocation techniques are\\nneeded to satisfy the requirements of 5g and beyond to\\nachieve minimized signaling overload in the cellular network\\n(base station), obtain acceptable user data rates, maximize\\nnetwork throughput, and meet qos demands.\\n\\nb. interference management\\ninterference from cellular users (cus) is one of the primary\\nimpairments inﬂuencing d2d communication. reuse of cel-\\nlular network resources and, therefore, the coexistence of\\n\\ncus and d2d pairs will lead to elevated interference prob-\\nlems. d2d user experience often suffers from two types of\\ninterference; intracell and intercell interference. both depend\\non operation modes of the d2d network and could occur\\nin uplink or downlink scenarios [31]. they can obstruct\\nsuccessful transmissions through signal to noise ratio (snr)\\nreduction at the receiver end and result in decreased qos\\nas well. transmitted power as a reduction technique is usu-\\nally implemented to mitigate the effect of ues interferences.\\nhowever, it results in a qos tradeoff at the receiver end.\\n\\nvarious interference management techniques have been\\ndiscussed and proposed in previous studies, including inter-\\nference coordination,\\ninterference avoidance, and inter-\\nference cancellation. moreover, transmissions scheduling,\\nhybrid automatic repeat request (harr), coding, and modu-\\nlation techniques are also implemented to improve the robust-\\nness of the signal against noise and mitigate unwanted inter-\\nference [32]. research in the approaches mentioned above\\nremains active.\\n\\nthe future direction of interference management of d2d\\nin 5g networks concentrates on the power control and inter-\\nference mitigation techniques, and both can lead to improved\\nenergy utilization, which is one of the essential aims of the\\nfuture generation of wireless networks.\\n\\nc. compatibility between devices in\\nheterogeneous

hence,\\nto establish an\\nefﬁcient connection and acquire compatibility among all\\nthese different devices, a d2d heterogeneous network is\\nneeded to support multiple communication systems diver-\\nsity [121],\\n[122]. a new design of a heterogeneous\\nwireless network between bluetooth low energy (ble)\\nand wi-fi with a high data rate (halow) was studied\\nin [160], which was achieved through a vertical han-\\ndover scenario. both ble and halow technologies work\\non different frequency bands, and the coexistence of both\\ndiverse networks does not require an interference avoidance\\nmechanism.\\n\\nfuture research will be focused on establishing a fully reli-\\nable communication link between different devices in diverse\\nnetworks, which requires new transportation and translation\\nprotocols to develop a uniﬁed compatible global system,\\nin which data sharing between various d2d users in the iot\\necosystem in udn is facilitated.\\n\\nd. mode selection\\nmode selection (ms) is a critical\\nissue in d2d com-\\nmunication and is an efﬁcient method that\\nimproves\\nenergy efﬁciency, network throughput, and reduces interfer-\\nence [161], [162]. it determines whether d2d users could\\noperate under a direct mode or cellular mode, and it could\\nselect static or dynamic time scale [163]. the selection of\\ncommunication mode for dues is a ﬂexible process when\\ndues select the d2d mode; the latency can be reduced, and a\\nhigher spectrum resource utilization could be achieved [161].\\ndifferent dues model selection and algorithms have been\\ninvestigated for d2d heterogeneous networks for various\\naims [125], [161], [164]. three d2d communication modes\\ncan be allocated by the base station (bs) to every d2d pair,\\nwhich comprises of direct d2d, local route, and relay d2d.\\na new optimal ms algorithm was proposed to maximize the\\ncapacity and cellular coverage in [165]. also, the effect of\\nms on the adequate capacity of d2d communication has\\n\\n30808\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n\\x0cm. s. m. gismalla et al.: survey on d2d communication for 5gb/6g networks\\n\\nbeen investigated in [166]. the development of optimal ms\\nalgorithms is an area of interest for future research directions,\\nwhich not only could obtain maximum capacity, but also\\nimprove spectral efﬁciency and reduce system interference.\\n\\ne. security\\nnowadays, d2d communication network security has\\nattracted attention due to the nature of data distribution across\\ncommunication networks. d2d pairs can distribute sensitive\\ninformation and data related to identifying the users and addi-\\ntional personal details [31], [126]. this information should\\nbe secure and safe to prevent any impersoniﬁcation, eaves-\\ndropping, ip spooﬁng, denial of service, and malware attack\\nby hackers for illegal purposes [32]. accordingly, network\\nsecurity protocols were developed in d2d networks, which\\nenable users to avoid information leakages.\\n\\ndynamic readjustment of d2d users due to mobility is a\\nsigniﬁcant issue in establishing secure d2d communication\\nnetworks. new and old d2d users may join and leave the\\ncoalition, which requires an adaptive mechanism for d2d\\ncommunication security [126]. moreover, a novel technique\\nthat utilizes interference signals as an impediment for security\\nwas introduced in [167], [168]. this was done by obstruct-\\ning the eavesdropping device. different security models and\\nalgorithms were designed to measure the security workload\\non heterogeneous mobile devices [169]–[171]. besides that,\\nan in-depth survey on security design aims was introduced\\nin [126], [157], [172]. the survey included authentication,\\nsecure routing, key management, physical layer, access con-\\ntrol, and additional security issues. however, many security\\nproblems remain to be discussed, which may open up many\\nresearch directions in the future, and great efforts must be met\\nto ensure d2d security.\\n\\nf. mobility\\nthe users are mobile in cellular networks, and communi-\\ncations are automatically activated and dropped based on\\nthe d2d user’s relative position. however, most research\\nrelated to d2d communication concentrated on static\\nusers [173], [174]. smart mobility solutions were proposed to\\nmitigate the network overhead due to signaling and enhance\\nthe d2d end-to-end (e2e) latency through maximizing the\\ntime when the due is controlled by the small cell itself [153].\\nmore investigation is required to explain how d2d perfor-\\nmance increases in dynamic scenarios, and what handover\\nand interference in the treating mechanism are needed as d2d\\nusers move across and within cells. also, the relay or multi-\\nhop d2d communication poses many challenges.\\n\\nvi. future of d2d communication in 6g network\\nthe sixth-generation (6g) of mobile communication is\\nexpected to launch commercially in 2030, which will allow\\nthe internet of everything (ioe). this will revolutionize the\\nlifestyle, intelligent mobile society, personal life, and com-\\nmunication and business systems. 5g and beyond will per-\\nhaps not be able to attain all ioe requirements [175]–[178],\\n\\nand this will push researchers towards looking for solutions\\nthat can meet higher demands in 6g. many researchers in\\nacademia and industrial ﬁelds have already started vision-\\ning, planning, and aggregating requirements of 6g technolo-\\ngies. also, many countries, such as china and finland, have\\nalready begun research on 6g topics. table 5 shows a com-\\nparison between 5g and the possible capabilities of future 6g.\\nthe challenges and problems of 6g are mainly focused\\non energy and spectrum efﬁciency, capacity, and system\\ncoverage, besides movement speed and user data rate [181].\\ntherefore, to solve these challenges, some key technologies\\nand novel approaches for 6g and beyond were presented,\\nas shown in fig.16 [176], including network slicing (ns),\\ncognitive network (cn), mobile edge computing (mec),\\nterahertz communication (thz). in addition to other tech-\\nnologies such as non-orthogonal multiple access (noma),\\nintelligent reﬂecting surfaces (irs), etc. [182].\\n\\nmoreover, to fulﬁll the requirements of 6g, artiﬁcial intel-\\nligence (ai) will be one of the innovative techniques that can\\nbe employed to obtain maintenance, intelligent automated\\nnetwork processes, and management of future heterogeneous\\nand complex 6g networks. driven by ai techniques, d2d\\ncommunication will become one of the most critical tech-\\nnologies in 6g networks and will play a signiﬁcant role in\\nreducing power consumption, delay, as well as improving\\nspectrum utilization and data rate [177], [182]–[184].\\n\\ntherefore, to create an efﬁcient, intelligent d2d communi-\\ncation (id2d) in the future 6g, several possible d2d commu-\\nnication solutions are illustrated in fig.17. incorporation of\\nid2d communication in complex 6g networks demands the\\npotential integration of d2d with the advanced technologies\\nmentioned above.\\n\\nthe efﬁcient implementation of id2d may require the\\n\\ndevelopment for at least the following techniques.\\n\\na. d2d based terahertz communication\\nover the past few years, carrier frequencies that operate for\\nwireless cellular communications have been growing to meet\\nbandwidth requirements [185]. researchers have proposed\\nhigh frequencies, such as mm-wave and optical wireless\\ncommunication (owc), to fulﬁl the exponential growth of\\ndata rate requests and to pave the route towards 5gb and 6g\\nnetworks.\\n\\nterahertz (thz) frequencies (0.1-10 thz) are a promising\\nprospect to support 5gb/6g with ultra-broadband, thus clos-\\ning the gap between owc and mmwave frequency ranges.\\nit has been expected to provide high data rates reaching up\\nto several tbps, along with low latency [186], [187]. the\\nthz can be applied in several applications, such as space\\ncommunication networks, wireless mobile communication,\\n3d beamforming technology, wireless data centres, and auto-\\nmotive applications. the development of antennas using new\\nmaterials and novel transceiver architectures can lead to the\\nreality of thz communication.\\n\\na theoretical model was designed for d2d communication\\nin thz band, which improved energy efﬁciency and data\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n30809\\n\\n\\x0ctable 5. comparison of 5g

improvement purposes. these\\nchallenges include hardware circuits of thz rf equipment,\\nthz antennas, and thz modulator.\\n\\nb. d2d-enabled intelligent network slicing\\nthe 6g networks are expected to advance ﬂexible\\nmulti-services with a range of speciﬁcations. the division\\nof a physical network into various virtual networks is known\\nas network slicing (ns) [190]. it can be deployed in vehicular\\napplications that demand high reliability, low latency, and\\nmaximum network capacity. besides, ns is expected to\\nreduce operational and system capital expenses, as well as\\nofﬂoading the core network.\\n\\nthe ns is the most important technology to address the\\nvariety of d2d-based services, whereby these devices can\\ncommunicate with multiple nss or speciﬁc services simul-\\ntaneously [38]. the integration of ns with d2d has been\\nenvisioned to improve the system performance in several\\nhuge numbers of connected devices in varied applications.\\nsome challenges affect the integration of d2d with ns, thus\\ndegrading the performance of the system network including\\ninterference and resource management, as well as new slice\\ncreation techniques. these challenges are bound to open the\\nway for researchers to develop new techniques and tools for\\nfurther enhancement.\\n\\nc. d2d based cognitive networking\\nthe ai is envisioned to obtain such cognition to wireless cel-\\nlular networks. the spectrum access, capacity enhancement,\\nand energy optimisation are the most signiﬁcant factors that\\nfulﬁl networks beyond 5g due to the daily demand for high\\ndata rate and the number of connected devices. a cognitive\\n\\nnetwork (cn) refers to automatic network management that\\napplied the available resources adaptively in a highly efﬁcient\\nmanner [191]. these cns have the potential to offer robust\\nand adaptive communication systems through their capability\\nto analyse and monitor the present state of the network,\\nas well as high bandwidth. most studies have looked into\\nuse of d2d in cellular networks with minimum interference,\\nwhile research work that has incorporated d2d and cn\\nto optimise spectrum utilisation and energy efﬁciency is in\\nscarcity.\\n\\nthe integration of d2d with cn has been implemented for\\nunderlay cellular networks to improve spectrum efﬁciency\\nand qos [192], [193]. besides, several models of cogni-\\ntive d2d communication have been proposed to enhance\\nenergy harvesting. the incorporation of d2d with cn in\\n6g ecosystem is expected to offer better d2d performance,\\nwhile concurrently supporting various kinds of services and\\napplications.\\n\\nd. d2d based intelligent reflecting surfaces\\nin conventional wireless cellular systems, the transmitter\\ndelivers radio or electromagnetic signals to the receiver\\nthrough an uncontrollable propagation atmosphere. for\\n5gb and 6g networks, there is fast-growing attention to\\ndevelop real-time reconﬁgurable propagation atmospheres\\nthat enhance the communication between transmitter and\\nreceiver. this involves distributing special surfaces called\\nintelligent reﬂecting surfaces (irs) [194], [195]. the irss\\ncan change and control the direction of the transmitted sig-\\nnal using low-cost passive devices, such as phase shifters\\nand printed dipoles [196]. the irs is a promising candi-\\ndate technology for 6g networks, mainly because it offers\\nhigh energy and spectrum efﬁciencies, robust security, and\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n30811\\n\\n\\x0coptimum beamforming, apart from its usage in other novel\\n6g applications [197].\\n\\nthe integration of d2d with distributed irs is detailed\\nin [198] to improve the transmission rate of d2d pairs,\\nwhereby signiﬁcant results were reported. the irs facilitates\\nd2d communication based on a two-timescale optimisation\\nalgorithm by minimising the co-channel interference between\\nd2d devices and cellular users (cus) [199]. the irs-based\\nd2d communication is bound to improve wireless networks\\nperformance in 6g by smartly reconﬁguring both transmis-\\nsion direction and atmosphere.\\n\\ne. id2d-enhanced mobile edge computing\\nsince the past few years, cloud computing (cc) has trans-\\nformed the topography of information technology and turned\\nthe long-term pledge of utility computing into a truth. how-\\never, cc has failed to meet the requirements of mobility sup-\\nport, location awareness, and low latency [200]. mobile edge\\ncomputing (mec) is in proximity to end-users (bs), supports\\nmobility, and has the ability to solve the aforementioned\\nproblems. the mec allows billions of interconnected mobile\\ndevices to conduct real-time compute-intensive implemen-\\ntations instantly at network edges (i.e., bs). besides, mec\\noffers cc capabilities and it service environment, which\\ncan enhance security and save mobile energy [201], [202].\\nthe integration of d2d with mec technologies to minimise\\nenergy consumption has been addressed in [203], whereby\\nlow complexity algorithm was initiated to overcome latency\\nconstraints.\\n\\na novel ultra-dense d2d structure for 5g mec was pro-\\nposed to enhance energy efﬁciency. by jointly integrating and\\nsharing communication resources and heterogeneous com-\\nputation between mobile devices, ultra-dense d2d enables\\na wide range of services and novel applications that require\\nhybrid types of resources [204]. an integrated framework of\\nd2d and mec using ofdma has been designed for inter-\\nference management and partial ofﬂoading. the latency min-\\nimisation problem has been discussed for the integrated sce-\\nnario by considering the required partial ofﬂoading, energy\\nconsumption, and resource assignment constraints [205]. the\\nmec promises a surprising decrease in mobile energy con-\\nsumption and latency, thus the ability to address the main\\nchallenges for emerging 5gb/6g visions.\\n\\non the other hand, a new promising technology beyond\\nd2d communication termed uavs to everything communi-\\ncations abbreviated by (u2x) was introduced. a uav aircraft\\nthat does not require a human pilot uses different sensory data\\nto collect information and data, and then transmits it over cel-\\nlular links [206]. the communication requirements of uavs\\nare different from sensing applications and require a ﬂexi-\\nble communication framework. furthermore, the internet of\\nuav will be a novel paradigm in the wireless communication\\nﬁeld, in which several sensing applications could be deployed\\nin 6g [207], [208]. fig 17 presents a general overview of d2d\\ncommunication in 6g networks. it highlights d2d concepts\\nthat could be extended from indoor environments and smart\\n\\nm. s. m. gismalla et al.: survey on d2d communication for 5gb/6g networks\\n\\nhomes to intra ship communication, building to building\\n(b2b), manufacturing, and so on.\\n\\nvii. lesson learned\\nthis section outlines the major derived lessons learned from\\nin-depth investigation and analyses on d2d communication\\nat the forefront of the envisioned 5gb and 6g connectivity.\\nthe following lists the lessons captured:\\n\\na. lesson one\\nin summary, d2d communication is a forefront candidate\\ntechnology for short communications in future generations.\\ndevices can communicate directly without relaying infor-\\nmation signals via bs, as introduced in conventional wire-\\nless cellular networks. the d2d communication offers high\\npower and spectral efﬁciencies, along with ﬂexible infras-\\ntructure and low latency. it has been applied in many applica-\\ntions containing data services and local voice, online gaming,\\nm2m, emergency networks, video streaming, and other novel\\napplications in future generation networks.\\n\\nthe 5gb and 6g facilitate network connectivity among\\nmassive numbers of devices. the distribution of many small\\ncells known as udn can enhance d2d communication trans-\\nmission delays and capacity. some key challenges demand\\ndiscussion and investigation to fulﬁl extraordinary capacity,\\ndata rate, and low latency for 5gb and 6g networks.\\n\\nb. lesson two\\nrapid growth, innovations, and advancements in mobile com-\\nmunications technologies have led to a huge number of\\nhetnets, which enable the connection of different devices\\nand appliances. in order to facilitate the connection of d2d\\nin hetnets, compatibility between devices is important to\\nsupport the diversity of multiple communication systems.\\n\\nc. lesson three\\nnotably, over 70% of data trafﬁc originates from indoor envi-\\nronments. the cutting-edge technologies have been reviewed\\nto provide high speed data rates and qos for mobile commu-\\nnication in 5gb and 6g networks. the integration of d2d\\nwith iot, udn, vlc, m2m, uav, c-ran, and mm-wave\\ncould be featured and prominent to improve network perfor-\\nmance. these integration efforts may also be the solutions\\nto many d2d communication challenges, including resource\\nallocation, security, interference management, model selec-\\ntion, and energy consumption.\\n\\nd. lesson four\\nemploying the d2d communication technology in 6g has\\nbecome attractive and garnered the attention of researchers.\\nhowever, only a handful of studies have envisioned the\\nimplementation of id2d communication in future 6g.\\nthe connectivity roadmap of\\nid2d communication to\\noffer extraordinary services for various recent and future\\napplications is discussed based on ai and new network\\ninfrastructures.\\n\\n30812\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n\\x0cm. s. m. gismalla et al.: survey on d2d

future 6g network is\\nbound to offer ﬂexible multi-services with several speciﬁ-\\ncations. the efﬁcient implementation of id2d requires the\\npotential incorporation of d2d with state-of-the-art technolo-\\ngies, such as thz, ns, cn, mec, and irs. these incorpo-\\nrations demand modiﬁcation in core and access networks to\\nproduce intelligent services in future innovative infrastruc-\\ntures.\\n\\nviii. key findings and suggestions for future\\nresearch\\na. review\\nthis paper presents an in-depth review of contemporary d2d\\ncommunication research work. the challenges of d2d com-\\nmunication in the context of 5gb and 6g are discussed with\\nopportunities and potential possible solutions. in future, the\\nimplementation of d2d communication in realistic scenar-\\nios should be investigated to analyse its performance, while\\nensuring its advantages with the capability to employ d2d\\ncommunication technology for novel applications in 5gb/6g\\nnetworks.\\n\\nb. taxonomy and past work\\nthis paper introduces d2d communication taxonomy with\\nextensive analysis of several published work related to\\nd2d performance in terms of interference management,\\n\\nresource allocation, mode selection, mobility, heterogeneous\\nnetwork, and security. various techniques, methods, and\\nalgorithms have been proposed previously to improve spec-\\ntrum and energy efﬁciencies, data rates, throughput, and\\nqos. nonetheless, the data trafﬁc, the number of connected\\ndevices, and the need for high capacity have been increasing\\non daily basis, along with the existence of limitations in\\nbandwidth or resources. hence, more investigations on d2d\\ncommunication are required to meet future 5gb/6g networks\\nrequirements.\\n\\nc. heterogeneous networks\\nhetnets platform enables several devices with different\\nattributes and protocols to transmit and receive data over\\nunderlay or overlay cellular networks. the d2d communica-\\ntion in hetnets can effectively minimise network signalling\\npressure and relieve bs power consumption. hence, future\\nresearch endeavour should concentrate on establishing a com-\\npletely reliable d2d communication link among varying\\ndevices in diverse networks that demands new transportation\\nand translation protocols to develop a uniﬁed compatible\\nglobal system; facilitating data sharing among various d2d\\nusers in the iot ecosystem in udn.\\n\\nd. integration\\nthe integration of d2d communication with other advanced\\ntechnologies is foreseeable to convert\\nfuture network\\n\\nvolume 10, 2022\\n\\n30813\\n\\n\\x0carchitectures. this integration places d2d technology at the\\nforefront of the envisioned 5gb/6g connectivity roadmap.\\nthis paper initiates a discussion that revolves around the ben-\\neﬁts of d2d integration with several technologies, including\\nc-ran, mm-wave, iot, vlc, udns, and uavs, to sup-\\nport 5gb and 6g networks. nevertheless, some of these\\nadvanced techniques face challenges as reported previously,\\nwhich can deteriorate the d2d communication performance\\nand affect the integration process. hence, future research\\nwork should begin devising new techniques, approaches,\\nalgorithms, and tools to overcome these reported challenges\\nfor further enhancement.\\n\\ne. security\\nincorporating d2d communication into 5g hetnets and\\nbeyond is still in its infancy stage and faces multiple security\\nthreats. the 3gpp standardised aka protocols are inap-\\npropriate for d2d due to dissimilarities in the communica-\\ntion scenario and architecture. only aggregated signatures\\nand cryptography have been investigated so far; signifying\\nnumerous untapped security issues that should be tackled in\\norder to enhance security and minimise resource consump-\\ntion.\\n\\nin future, researchers should consider developing a novel\\naka protocol for d2d pairs, besides building new secu-\\nrity models to facilitate communication between devices in\\n5gb/6g hetnets.\\n\\nf. ai\\nartiﬁcial intelligence (ai) and machine learning (ml) are\\nprominent technologies that have been expected to drive\\nd2d communication in 6g networks. the implementation\\nof efﬁcient id2d in 6g networks demands the incorporation\\nwith at least one of the key techniques of thz, ns, cn, irs,\\nand mec. the id2d in 6g may support the growth of novel\\nubiquitous intelligent applications with intelligent industries\\nand life. studies on id2d in 6g networks is under discussion\\nand more investigations are required from researchers in both\\nacademia and industries ﬁelds.\\n\\nix. conclusion\\nd2d communication is an emerging and promising tech-\\nnology and is a crucial factor in fulﬁlling 5g generation\\nrequirements. this is due to its relatively valuable features\\nand advantages, as mentioned earlier in the literature. in this\\npaper, we have prepared a comprehensive survey on d2d\\ncommunication and a review of contemporary research that\\nhas been done relating to d2d communication concepts, clas-\\nsiﬁcation, and various application scenarios. furthermore,\\nd2d integration with other emerging technologies was thor-\\noughly discussed as well, and suggestions for future trends\\nwere proposed. various possible solutions for 5gb network\\nperformance improvements were presented as well. further-\\nmore, the main contributions of this paper are in presenting an\\nin-depth review of problems concerning d2d communication\\nin the context of 5gb networks and beyond. in addition,\\n\\nm. s. m. gismalla et al.: survey on d2d communication for 5gb/6g networks\\n\\nan analysis of various published approaches related to d2d\\nperformance in terms of interference management, resource\\nallocation, mode selection, mobility, heterogeneous network,\\nand security was presented. the vital role that d2d com-\\nmunication plays in the success of upcoming 6g networks\\nwas introduced and investigated. lastly, a direction of open\\nresearch challenges of d2d communication and their possi-\\nble solutions for the future was proposed.\\n\\nreferences\\n\\n[1] o. a. amodu, m. othman, n. k. noordin, and i. ahmad,\\n‘‘a primer on design aspects, recent advances, and challenges in\\ncellular
